## Project Requirements
An overall introduction to your project, including the topic and tasks. (5 pts)
- A paragraph to introduce the data, including the size, source and attributes. (5 pts)
- At least two links to the references. (5 pts)
- You have at least 5 data data visualizations. At least 1 of the visualization is made with Altair and at
least 1 of the visualization is made with D3. (5 pts)
- All data visualizations have clear titles, labels, legends (if need). At least 3 of the figures need to have
customized settings (color, shape, layout etc.) We also need a paragraph to explain the takeaway of
the visualization on the webpage, and a paragraph to explain the design idea for the visualization on
the separated word document. (40 pts)
- Among the 5 data visualizations, at least 3 different kinds of the interaction should be implemented.
Interactive functions are well-explained and easy to be used. The interaction functions are meaningful
and can help people learn more about the data compare to a static plot. The interaction works. (20
pts)
- A summary for your findings, including what you have learned from the data visualization and what
can be done in the future. (10 pts)
- Format, including correctly publish the website, no grammar error and keep the webpage tidy and
clear.(10 pts)
Here are special notes for the requirement:
- We will expect the 5 data visualization to be somehow different from each other.
– Not acceptable: 5 scatter plots
3
– Acceptable: 2 scatter plots, 1 map, 1 histogram, 1 bar plot
- Think about the design of the website. The figures should relatively have similar style, including
consistent color theme, title and labels.
- The five figures should not be independent. It will be great if there is a logic/relation to connect all of
them. For example, from a general overview to a specific case comparison.
- In the end of the project, we will expect you to have 2-3 constructive conclusions/suggestions. Those
conclusions should be corresponding to your title and your topic of the project.
