    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        Using large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT to assist in writing code has become a common practice for students and industry
        professionals alike. While LLMs are a great tool for assisting developers in small coding tasks, they often struggle with writing 
        efficient, sensible code. This project investigates the ability of different LLMs to write Python solutions to easy and medium programming
        problems.

    <h2>Visualizations</h2>

      <p> <b>Figure 1: </b> In figure one you will see two bar charts comparing the performance of three models (copilot, gpt-4o, and o3-mini) on tasks of varying difficulty (Easy and Medium). The left chart shows the mean execution time in milliseconds for each model, while the right chart displays the mean number of lines of code required.
        The charts indicate that while copilot tends to have higher execution times and longer code lengths compared to gpt-4o and o3-mini across both task difficulties (Easy and Medium), o3-mini consistently performs with lower execution times and shorter code lengths.

      <p> <b>Figure 2: </b> Figure 2 shows a scatter plot titled "log(Execution Time) vs Number of Lines," with the x-axis ranging from 0 to 35 and the y-axis from -5.0 to 1.0. Data points for gpt-4o (blue), o3-mini (green), and Microsoft Copilot (red) are shown, with a legend at the bottom identifying each model.
        The scatter plot highlights the differences in performance characteristics between the three models, with gpt-4o and o3-mini showing more efficient execution times relative to the number of lines of code compared to Microsoft Copilot.

      <p> <b>Figure 3: </b>Figure 3, "Execution Times by Difficulty Level and Model" shows execution times (0 to 0.8 ms) for GPT-4o, o3-mini, and Copilot across Easy and Medium difficulty levels.
        The box plot chart highlights the differences in execution time distributions between the three models, with gpt-4o and o3-mini generally showing faster and more consistent performance compared to copilot.

    <h2>Conclusions</h2>
    <br>
    <p><b>Performance Consistency:</b> gpt-4o and o3-mini show more efficient and reliable performance compared to Microsoft Copilot, which has higher variability.</p>
    <p><b>Execution Time Trends:</b> Execution time increases with code length, but gpt-4o and o3-mini maintain lower times than Copilot.</p>  
    <p><b>Code Length Efficiency:</b> gpt-4o and o3-mini generate shorter code solutions on average compared to Copilot.</p>
    <p><b>Outliers and Variability:</b> Copilot has more pronounced outliers and variability in execution times, especially for Easy tasks.</p>
    <p><b>In summary,</b> gpt-4o and o3-mini demonstrate more efficient and consistent performance in terms of execution time and code length, while Microsoft Copilot shows greater variability and higher execution times, potentially handling a broader range of tasks but with less efficiency.</p>
