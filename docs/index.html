    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        Using large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT to assist in writing code has become a common practice for students and industry
        professionals alike. While LLMs are a great tool for assisting developers in small coding tasks, they often struggle with writing 
        efficient, sensible code. This project investigates the ability of different LLMs to write Python solutions to easy and medium programming
        problems.
